# PageRank
In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin published a paper titled "The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web". 
There, they described the PageRank algorithm and provided heuristics demonstrating its convergence. In the Spring of 
2025, I took an elective course called "Mathematical and Computational Foundations of Data Science". For the final project, 
I opted to study the PageRank algorithm. I ended up formulating a rigorous proof of the PageRank algorithm's convergence 
via Banach's fixed point theorem, thereby supplementing the heuristics in the original paper.
